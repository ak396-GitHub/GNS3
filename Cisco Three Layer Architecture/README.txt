Project Title: Cisco Three Layer Architecture

Author: Antriksh Pathania <akpathania396@gmail.com>

This project is all about implementing the Cisco Three Layer  Architecture
and prepare a network design for a three-story biulding with all the benefits
of Cisco Three Layer Architecture. 

We have minimized the cost by configuring port-security.

We have minimized the IP address wastage by properly Subnetting our network.

We are using Redundant Links for optimum netwrok-up-times and reliability.

OSPF routing has been used in the network so that network devices from various vendors 
can be used.

We have established a DHCP server for providing IP addresses to the devices.

Also, the Vlans are being managed by the VTP Server, Transported by the VTP Transparent 
and all the access layer switches are being used as a VTP Client.

Follwing are the Virtual Local Area Networks along with there Network Addresses and CIDR values:
